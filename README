WikiImport
==========

This plugin can enable to import notes from a remote MediaWiki installation
into the dradis Framework.

The plugin performs a text search against the WikiMedia API. See 
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API for further reference.

Example
=======

The current implementation assumes that the wiki is installed in the default 
path "mediawiki-1.14.0". A sample query as performed by te plugin would be:

http://localhost/mediawiki-1.14.0/api.php? \
  action=query&format=xml&generator=search&gsrsearch=<search>&prop=revisions&rvprop=content

This can be adjusted in lib/wiki-import/filters.rb
