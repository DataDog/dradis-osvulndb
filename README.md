# VulnDB add-on for Dradis

A simple plugin to import issues from a [VulnDB](https://github.com/vulndb/data) in the Dradis Framework.

The idea is to be able to use a VulnDB repository as a library of re-usable report entries for your projects.

The add-on requires [Dradis CE](https://dradisframework.org/) > 3.0, or [Dradis Pro](https://dradisframework.com/pro/).
